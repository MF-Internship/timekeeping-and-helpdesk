## Notes

- Validation passed on the first review iteration (2026-08-20): all 16 quality items pass.
- The specification contains no clarification markers. The literal marker text appears only in this checklist's validation-item label.
- Scope boundary verified against `docs/CHOT_YEU_CAU.md`: Feature 007 includes photo/GPS field evidence and the separately authorized zero-photo/no-GPS Manager override path under the shared terminal-state invariant.
